# HW assignment 1 for "Numerical Algorithms for Scientific Computing" course

For problem 1 (directory p1), I created a parallel code to calculate the Mandelbrot set.  For problem 2 (directory p2), I created some tests 
for some existing integrators.  This was a kind of "warm-up" assignment for the course.

Unfortunately, I didn't track changes of this code with git, so this code doesn't have a robust git history.  However, the Mandelbrot set code 
was cool enough that I decided to post it anyway.
